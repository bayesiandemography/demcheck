\title{Check that pairs of numbers specifying 
labels do not overlap}
\usage{
chk_no_overlap_intervals(x, name)

chk_no_overlap_quantities(x, name)

err_no_overlap_intervals(x, name)

err_no_overlap_quantities(x, name)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of integer vectors of length 2.}

\item{name}{The name for \code{x} to be used
in error messages.}
}
\description{
Look for cases where the first pair starts at or below the
second pair, and finished in or above the second pair.
Function 'outer' covers all combinations of pairs,
in both orders, so looking only at overlaps from below
finds all overlaps.
}
\details{
Different functions are needed for intervals and
quantities because intervals allow the second number
of the lower pair to equal the first number of the upper pair,
while quantities do not. The labels, which the
check functions use in return values, also differ.

values <- list(c(NA, 20L), c(20L, 30L), c(30L, NA))
